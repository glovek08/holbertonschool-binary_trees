## Description
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. This project implements various binary tree operations, including creation, traversal, and manipulation.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, we've achieved:
- Understanding of the structure and properties of binary trees.
- Learn how to implement binary tree operations in C.
- Practice algorithmic problem-solving with tree-based challenges.

---

## Requirements
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler:** `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic`
- Follow the Betty coding style.
- All code files must end with a new line.
